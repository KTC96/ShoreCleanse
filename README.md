# SUBMISSION
## Deployment

The project is deployed and can be accessed at [here](https://shore-cleanse-0fb5ac9c4936.herokuapp.com/).



# ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro
ShoreCleanse is a site designed to encourage and help users find local beach clean up events in their area. It allows users to create profiles to connect with likeminded individuals for environmental events, document their trash collection (if they're from the west west, rubbish collection for the rest of the world), and provides updated statistics on environmental facts and figures.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to produce a functioning piece of technology that will benefit a greener tomorrow.  

Following the criteria set out by the hackathon facilitators and incorporating the hard work, sweat,  skills, abilities and testing of patience of each team member while enjoying the process of learning to develop new and unique software.

Some of the most important factors of the project include:

  - Organizing a group of <strike>weirdos </strike>strangers with varying abilities to join together to create a functioning site in a limited time frame with both frontend and backend from their, ehm, backends.
  - The languages used will be new to some members of the team (and less colorful for others), but will be a great learning curve for all.
  - Working together and seeing all members differing visions coming together in symphony, much like the frog chorus of yore.



## User Stories


* As a user, I want to be able to log into the website and browse upcoming beach cleanup events so that I can sign up for any that I might be interested in.
* As a user, I want to view photos of previous beach cleanups so that I can see the impact of the events and community involvement.
* As a user, I want to view upcoming events so that I can find more information about the event and join a beach clean up.
* As a user, I want to upload my trash collected to keep track of the waste on the shores and review my impact over time.
* As a user, I want to be able to navigate to a 'Where To Find Us' page so that I can find 'ShoreCleanse's location and contact details.

## Design
### Typography


- The font chosen for the site was Source Sans 3 - a Sans Serif font. It was picked from Google Fonts as we wanted an easy to read font that was inviting for a user to continue reading and browsing throughout the site.
